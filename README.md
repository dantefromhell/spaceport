## spaceport
Collaborative, team-focused TiddlyWiki docker image with added opinionation.


## Vision

`spaceport` serves as a non-linear inbox for ideas, information snippets and connections. Through visualization(s)
information can be arranged and curated spatially. Through addition and curation of information faint ideas have a
space to grow and gain clarity and transform into actionable projects.

Inspired by the processes in the human brain, but for remote-first teams.
